abstract: This paper proposes a model of a class of regular virtual tubes that can generate safe, feasible, and smooth space for a robotics swarm in an obstacle-dense environment, especially for a drone swarm based on the flocking model. The regular principles are first proposed, and the regular conditions are then formulated based on the principles. A method to obtain a regular virtual tube is also presented based on trajectory planning and regular conditions. The proposed method's effectiveness and robustness are comprehensively demonstrated in a simulation environment with random obstacles.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper proposes a model of regular virtual tubes to generate safe and smooth paths for drone swarms in obstacle-dense environments, introduces regular principles and conditions, presents a method for obtaining these tubes through trajectory planning, and validates the method's effectiveness and robustness via simulations with random obstacles.
